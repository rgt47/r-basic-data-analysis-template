# Basic Data Analysis in R

## Overview
Welcome to the Basic Data Analysis in R assignment! In this assignment, you will practice fundamental data analysis techniques using R. You'll work with a dataset of student test scores to perform data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

## Learning Objectives
By completing this assignment, you will be able to:
- Import and explore datasets in R
- Calculate descriptive statistics
- Create various data visualizations
- Perform correlation analysis
- Build and interpret a simple linear regression model

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- R installed on your computer (version 3.6.0 or higher recommended)
- RStudio (recommended) or another R IDE
- Basic knowledge of R syntax

### Repository Structure
- `README.md`: This file containing instructions
- `data/student_scores.csv`: Dataset for analysis
- `starter-code/analysis.R`: Starter code with tasks to complete

## Assignment Description

You are provided with a dataset (`student_scores.csv`) containing information about 15 students, including their test scores, study hours, and subjects. Your task is to analyze this data to understand the relationships between these variables.

### Part 1: Data Import and Exploration (25%)
1. Load the provided dataset into R
2. Display the first few rows to understand its structure
3. Check the data types of each column
4. Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, min, max, etc.) for each numerical variable

### Part 2: Data Visualization (25%)
1. Create a histogram showing the distribution of student scores
2. Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between study hours and scores
3. Create a box plot comparing scores across different subjects
4. Ensure all visualizations have appropriate titles, labels, and legends

### Part 3: Analysis (25%)
1. Calculate the correlation coefficient between study hours and scores
2. Fit a simple linear regression model predicting scores based on study hours
3. Extract the model coefficients and interpret their meaning
4. Determine how well the model fits the data using R-squared

### Part 4: Interpretation and Conclusion (25%)
1. Write a brief summary of your findings
2. Discuss the relationship between study hours and test scores
3. Compare performance across different subjects
4. Suggest what other variables might influence test scores

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork this repository to create your own copy
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Complete the tasks in the starter code
4. Commit your changes with clear commit messages
5. Push your completed assignment to GitHub
6. Submit the link to your repository by the deadline

## Evaluation Criteria

Your assignment will be evaluated based on:
- Correctness of code implementation
- Quality and clarity of visualizations
- Depth of analysis and interpretation
- Code organization and documentation
- Proper use of R functions and features

## Tips for Success

- Start by exploring the data thoroughly before jumping to analysis
- Use comments to explain your code and reasoning
- Test your code frequently to ensure it works as expected
- Refer to R documentation when needed
- Don't hesitate to ask questions if you're stuck
